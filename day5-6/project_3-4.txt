store day2 on github and then start this effort.

major change in the project.

change the model:
replace with a double linked list
each node has an int field : key
support operations:
add at either end
remove at either end

change the views.
- view_count : finds the # of nodes
- view_sum : finds the total of all keys
- view_first : display the first key 
- view_last : display the last key

The structure developed on day2 should remain the same.
Follow the same procedure.
